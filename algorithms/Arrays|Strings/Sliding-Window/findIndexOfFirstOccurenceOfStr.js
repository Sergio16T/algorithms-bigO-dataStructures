Approach 1: Sliding Window

Time complexity: O(hn).

For every window_start, we may have to iterate at most lengthOfWindow times. There are h - lengthOfWindow +1 such window_start's.
Thus, it is O((h-lengthOfWindow+1) â‹… m), which is O(h * lengthOfWindow) e.g. O (hn)

space complexity: O(1)

There are a handful of variables in the code (m, n, i, window_start), and all of them use constant space, hence, the space complexity is constant.
