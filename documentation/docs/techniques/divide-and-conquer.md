# Recognizing the Divide and Conquer Pattern

Divide and conquer is characterized by three main steps:

Divide: Split the problem into smaller subproblems of the same type.

Conquer: Solve each subproblem recursively.

Combine: Merge the solutions of the subproblems to form the solution to the original problem.
When analyzing a problem, look for the following clues to determine if divide and conquer might be useful:

Recursive Substructure: The problem can be broken down into similar subproblems.

Independent Subproblems: Each subproblem can be solved independently (no need to reference each other directly).

Mergeable Solutions: Solutions from subproblems can be combined to create the final solution.
If you see these characteristics, divide and conquer may be a good fit.
