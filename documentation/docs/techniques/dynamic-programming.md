# Dynamic Programming

Recall that there are two different techniques we can use to implement a dynamic programming solution; memoization and tabulation.

Memoization is where we add caching to a function (that has no side effects). In dynamic programming, it is typically used on recursive functions for a top-down solution that starts with the initial problem and then recursively calls itself to solve smaller problems.

Tabulation uses a table to keep track of subproblem results and works in a bottom-up manner: solving the smallest subproblems before the large ones, in an iterative manner. Often, people use the words "tabulation" and "dynamic programming" interchangeably.

For most people, it's easiest to start by coming up with a recursive brute-force solution and then adding memoization to it. After that, they then figure out how to convert it into an (often more desired) bottom-up tabulated algorithm.
